    <title>We Are Living Inside the Matrix and the Rapper Pitbull Is the Proof</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HSBfd9EFMIhAWgO5DHH2V0hyn5w=/167x0:2834x2000/400x300/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56155767/cypher_pitbull_getty_warner_bros_ringer.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;What if Cypher got his wish to be rich and famous, and became the rapper Pitbull and we are all living in a simulation? Just asking!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="JNUYyF"&gt;This feeling has been weighing on me for a while. An unreal, unsettled sensation that paints the familiar in strange light. Am I awake or am I dreaming? It’s hard to know. Sometimes the feeling lasts only a moment — a chill passing through my body on a hot day. Other times it crests and holds, and then fades slowly. Like when a roomful of people explodes into raucous conversation for no discernible reason. My favorite coffee mug feeling lighter than usual. The correct spelling of a word I use a million times a day looking inexplicably wrong on my computer screen, the cursor blinking accusingly just to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AjQWw"&gt;In these moments, forgotten memories bubble up so vividly — exquisite sunlight through the classroom windows glistening against the downy hairs on my crush’s left arm as she blackens the bubbles on a Scantron form with the green no. 2 pencil I lent her the week before. It’s as if they were placed there just so by some wizened cosmic architect. Are they even mine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4BteH"&gt;Logging onto the internet these days feels like staring into a sandblaster of the absurd. Last summer, on Facebook, one of my oldest, dearest friends outed himself as an ardent Trump supporter. He believes, among other things, that giving women the right to vote “weakened the social fabric of the country.” He and his wife, also a close friend, have two daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idQwOs"&gt;A chunk of ice the size of Delaware (or, as &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; put it, “twice the size of Luxembourg”; PS — congratulations, Delaware) recently came unmoored from the increasingly imperiled Antarctic ice shelf; the animals (according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/07/12/earth-is-on-its-way-to-the-biggest-mass-extinction-since-the-dinosaurs-scientists-warn/?utm_term=.7751cf640658"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt;) are dying; there was that thing at the Oscars; dogs &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/04/30/476212898/lets-not-hug-it-out-with-our-dogs"&gt;apparently hate hugs&lt;/a&gt;; Donald Trump is the fucking president. The world has turned darkly upside down. How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b07cs7"&gt;There are two ways to approach that question — the right and the wrong. The wrong way would be to examine the philosophies, histories, and global forces that delivered us &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html?_r=0"&gt;rampant inequality&lt;/a&gt; and the wanton destruction of the earth. That leads nowhere. The right way is to pursue truth by studying the 1999 sci-fi action epic &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;. That’s where the answers are. Because that’s where &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are. We live in the fucking Matrix. And I can prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F95M0w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="bxjAuH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, which is popularly regarded as a science-fiction film, is, in fact, part documentary, part Machine false-flag operation, was released in the year commonly thought of as 1999. It tells the story of a solitary hacker named Neo, who realizes his destiny is to deliver humanity from the vast virtual prison where a race of oppressive machines uses us as batteries. This is not a work of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wv4HAg"&gt;Neo is abetted by a raffish collection of heroes: the wise Morpheus, who awakens Neo from his digital slumber; the fiercely beautiful Trinity, whose love gives Neo a reason to believe; the energetic young Mouse; the ice-blonde Switch and black-haired Apoc, of whom we know very little; the Earth-born duo Tank and Dozer; and, lastly, Cypher, who yearns for the Matrix’s virtual comforts, ultimately betraying Neo and Morpheus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoqAu4"&gt;Midway through the “film,” Cypher meets with the Agents, the elite virtual security force, inside a restaurant in the Matrix. There, over a digital reproduction of a blood-red steak, Cypher agrees to sell out Morpheus in return for a life of ease, wealth, and celebrity inside the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="leHvUf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75.0019%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z7BuQFUhsRM?rel=0&amp;amp;" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="50wWdu"&gt;“I don’t want to remember nothing,” Cypher tells Agent Smith. “Nothing, you understand? And I want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQPXr4"&gt;“Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrNleo"&gt;Later, still inside the Matrix, Cypher gives away the location of Morpheus and crew. Morpheus is taken prisoner. Mouse, Switch, Apoc, and Dozer are killed. Cypher slips into the real world. He kills Tank with an energy weapon and is about to kill Neo when he’s brought down by Dozer. But what if that’s just what the Machines want us to think? What if the Machines actually triumphed? What if Cypher’s deal actually was: slipping back into the simulation, where we all live, to take up his life as a rich and famous celebrity? &lt;em&gt;The Matrix &lt;/em&gt;was released in 1999. Two years later, in Miami, a then-unknown rapper named Pitbull began his strange and mysterious rise to international prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmgYmMjfZsX0F4iWtPOM8hC1fpA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9035197/Screen_Shot_2017_08_04_at_4.29.05_PM.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UV7Ex2"&gt;Pitbull is Cypher. Cypher is Pitbull. And we live in the Matrix. This explains everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3FWf9"&gt;Pitbull was born Armando Christian Perez in Miami in 1981. That’s if we assume that Pitbull, Miami, Florida, the United States of America, and the year 1981 AD are all the people, places, and concepts that we think they are. That’s if we assume the world we live in is real, not a simulacrum designed to keep us docile while our bodies are harvested for energy. Could such a thing be possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIZFJ2"&gt;“There’s a one-in-billions chance that this is base reality,” said Elon Musk when asked about the possibility that we live in the Matrix at &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;’s Code Conference 2016. In English, that means that Musk thinks it’s likely, though not by a lot, that we’re right now living inside a simulation instead of real life. And he’s not alone. Noted astrophysicist and &lt;a href="http://www.thewrap.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-ruins-sci-fi-movies/"&gt;fun-ruiner&lt;/a&gt; Neil deGrasse Tyson puts the odds at a coin flip that we live in the Matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5M4kS"&gt;“The strongest argument for us being in a simulation is the following: Forty years ago, we had &lt;em&gt;Pong. &lt;/em&gt;Like, two rectangles and a dot. That was what games were,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation"&gt;Musk explained&lt;/a&gt; at Code Conference. “Forty years later we have photo-realistic, 3-D simulations, with millions of people playing simultaneously, and it’s getting better every year. If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the game will become indistinguishable from reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHtG3K"&gt;The world is shit, but don’t worry. It’s also fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClElAl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="jgztJ8"&gt;My theory, which is true and real, goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrZ6hq"&gt;The first half of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; depicts the last phase of the human-Machine war as it actually happened: Morpheus and the crew of the &lt;em&gt;Nebuchadnezzar&lt;/em&gt; freeing Neo from the simulation and their attempts to wake the human race from its slumber. The second half, after Cipher’s death, is Machine disinformation meant to keep us placid by delivering a classic Hollywood ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vK2iC"&gt;What actually happened is this: Cypher betrayed Morpheus. The Machines triumphed, Morpheus was captured, and Neo, Trinity, and the rest were killed. The Machines honored their deal, erased Cypher’s memories, and placed him back inside the Matrix. But not the actual one; the Machines created a Pocket Matrix, just for Cypher. Remember, the Matrix relies on choice in order to remain stable. As the Architect told Neo, the first iterations of the simulation were utopias that didn’t involve choice. Human minds rejected them, causing the Matrix to crash. The bargain the Machines struck with Cypher was to reinsert him under a set of specific parameters that applied only to him — wealth, fame, importance — that amount to, essentially, a personal utopia. Thus the Pocket Matrix; the Machines couldn’t risk infecting the wider system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8axW1"&gt;But you want proof. OK. First, the timeline. Pitbull makes his recording debut in 2001, not long after the “debut” of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;. His vast fame and success — Bud Light ads; a write-up in &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;; appearances on &lt;em&gt;The View&lt;/em&gt;; numerous hits that no one admits to liking (except maybe “Timber”); getting away with &lt;a href="http://www.gq.com/story/pitbull-baseball-jersey-tucked-in-high-pants"&gt;tucking his Marlins&lt;/a&gt; jersey into his pants; potentially joining an ownership group with Jeb Bush to buy the Marlins from the execrable Jeffrey Loria; his own Sirius Radio channel — is inexplicable. Unless you accept that he is Cypher and we live in his personal simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnxhJo"&gt;This is why our world is such a mess. Not because of ancient racial animus or because people are susceptible to appeals to naked nationalism or because liberal democracy is under siege by aggressive foreign powers or because wealth has been concentrated in the hands of the few. It’s because we live in an unstable version of the Matrix that was designed to fulfill the desires and dreams of only one man — Cypher-Pitbull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="155DlR"&gt;There are clues in Pitbull’s music. I asked noted rap historian, best-selling author, documentarian, and &lt;em&gt;Ringer&lt;/em&gt; staff writer Shea Serrano (these terms, by the way, are all constructs of the pocket Matrix) to look at the lyrics to the biggest hits Pitbull has been involved with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="U9T0kU"&gt;“Timber” (featuring Ke$ha)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="zuh58t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bigger they are, the harder they fall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This biggity boy’s a diggity dog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have ’em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Face down, booty up, timber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s the way we like the what, timber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m slicker than an oil spill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;She say she won’t, but I bet she will, timber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJXVRH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look up in the sky, it’s a bird, it’s a plane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nah, it’s just me, ain’t a damn thing changed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live in hotels, swing on plane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blessed to say, money ain’t a thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Club jumping like LeBron, now, Voli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Order me another round, homie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;We about to climb, wild, ’cause it’s about to go down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2PCX5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shea:&lt;/strong&gt; “The main thing here is he’s advocating for Big Oil. He confirms it in the second verse when he talks about having a lot of money (Big Oil $$$, it would seem) and that’s probably why he has to have sex on that airplane (because Big Oil is destroying the earth so the elite have taken to the skies like in that Matt Damon movie).That’s what all the “it’s going down” talk is about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKS9JJ"&gt;It’s notable that the album this track comes from is titled &lt;em&gt;Global Warming: Meltdown&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="z1NHtO"&gt;“Time of Our Lives” (featuring NeYo)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="nNCX8Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the last $20 I got&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But I’mma have a good time ballin’ or out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell the bartender line up some shots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cause I’mma get loose tonight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;She’s on fire, she’s so hot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m no liar, she burn up the spot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look like Mariah, I took another shot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it’s hot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dirty talk, dirty dance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;She a freaky girl and I’m a freaky man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;She on the rebound, broke up with her ex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And I’m like Rodman, ready on deck&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I told her I wanna ride out, and she said yes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;We didn’t go to church, but I got blessed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="magu5M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shea:&lt;/strong&gt; “You know what he’s doing in this one? He’s propagating the idea that reckless spending among the poverty-stricken is a good thing. AND! Even more offensive, he’s doing so by pretending to be poor himself. He raps about how he’s down to his last $20. The song came out in 2014. That same year Pitbull had a net worth of over $11 million. It’s shameful that he would pretend to be poor and then advocate blowing what little money you have. It’s a common strategy among the rich: you have to keep the disenfranchised disenfranchised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2wOzu"&gt;Notable, again, that the album this track appears on is titled &lt;em&gt;Globalization&lt;/em&gt;. Pitbull is Cypher. Cypher is the Illuminati. We live in his world. Gaze upon the truth and despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yy8q2J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IS8Eig"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="ziYtCG"&gt;Once you realize that the Pocket Matrix wasn’t built with you in mind, the world makes a lot more sense. Still, mysteries remain. Why does &lt;em&gt;The Matrix &lt;/em&gt;exist inside the Pitbull Pocket Matrix in the first place? Does it exist in the wider Matrix? And when we think of the movie &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, are the people we imagine inside of it aware that they’re not real? Does a cloud darken their faces when they glimpse imaginary Pitbull, with imaginary Marlins jersey tucked into imaginary white slacks, rapping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKmOaA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t play baseball but I’ve hit a home run everywhere, everywhere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve been to countries and cities I can’t pronounce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And the places on the globe I didn’t know existed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Romania she pulled me to the side and told me, “Pit, you can have me and my sister.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Lebanon, yeah, the women are bomb&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And in Greece — you’ve guessed it — the women are sweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Been all around the world but I ain’t gon’ lie–there’s nothing like Miami’s heat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SUgf3g"&gt;Has Pitbull even seen &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why You Shouldn’t Draft Le’Veon Bell</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p&gt;Our NFL experts dish out some fantasy football advice&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="caBtDI"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://art19.com/shows/the-ringer-nfl-show/episodes/c95962d7-8f1f-4919-a892-6739b8ad0151/embed?primary_color=%2367c385&amp;amp;theme=light-gray-blue" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="acSuyS"&gt;Robert Mays and Kevin Clark continue their 33 Preseason Questions leading up to opening night with some fantasy-draft advice, including someone on the Browns that can win you your league (04:15), how the Patriots finally have a reliable fantasy running back (07:30), and why you shouldn’t draft Le’Veon Bell early this year (10:15). Then, the guys weigh David Johnson vs. Zeke Elliott for first overall pick (18:15) and discuss why LeSean McCoy could be in for a down year (29:00). Finally, Robert and Kevin pick their RedZone channel MVPs and highlight some rookies that should find the end zone all season long (33:30).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There Are No More Excuses for Paul Pogba</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vF2fy_55G3GDeLMZuDsnxuRUATI=/0x0:3000x2250/400x300/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56155171/pogba_micah_getty_ringer.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Last season, Manchester United broke the transfer record to bring the French midfielder to England. This summer, the team spent to make his life on the field easier. Will he be able to live up to the enormous expectations? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="KmzFNp"&gt;We were impatient with Paul Pogba. By &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;, I mostly mean &lt;em&gt;not me&lt;/em&gt;, as I was not the one bringing up his price tag with every draw, loss, &lt;a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-pogba-lingard-savage-12584292"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt;, missed chance, or injudicious pass. Manchester United had a sixth place Premier League finish and EFL Cup and Europa League final victories last season. Maybe it wasn’t the Premier League title that’s supposed to follow spending €105 million on a single midfielder. For all that money, to say nothing of a glitzy &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Q04Z4bzGY"&gt;#POGBACK music video&lt;/a&gt;, it’s only instinctual (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/sports/soccer/paul-pogba-manchester-united.html?_r=0"&gt;if unreasonable&lt;/a&gt;) to assume you’ve bought an emphatic and immediate course correction (Manchester United were boring under Louis van Gaal), or at least a top-four finish, neither of which happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCzEL2"&gt;Going from Serie A to playing every meaningful minute in the Premier League with a heartbreaking stop at the Euros in between was always going to make getting Pogba’s acclimatization rough, but I forgive you your doubts. &lt;em&gt;We—&lt;/em&gt;my larger, superiorly talented French Muslim cousin and I—forgive you. And you can move on to complaining about Neymar da &lt;a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11820/10979383/neymar-considering-fifa-complaint-against-barcelona-say-sky-sources"&gt;Silver Money Bags&lt;/a&gt; Junior now. Though I should say, in the interest of balance, that Pogba could stand to play just &lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; percent more simply. Maybe 10. OK, like, 20:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1y9ieD"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HTo24D"&gt;Real Madrid won another trophy Wednesday, by the way. They have won, without looking, 500 of them this calendar year, 20 this month, and at least one already today. This particular piece of hardware happened to be the UEFA Super Cup, a tradition in which the Champions League winners (Madrid) play the Europa League winners (United) for the title of undisputed heavyweight champions of Europe, a full summer after that's already sort of been decided. Isco scored the winner, and United, who’ve spent the GNP of a small island nation since José Mourinho took charge, in order to be competitive at home and abroad, scored a moral victory. In fits and starts—say, the first and final 10 minutes or so—as they pressed and probed and inconvenienced the Spanish giants, it was possible to trick yourself into thinking that Gálacticos North stood a reasonable chance of winning against the flagship Gálacticos on that sticky night in Skopje. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR9EBa8wLJs"&gt;Hah, no&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TT7Ufu"&gt;For what it's worth, Madrid aren’t the standard of competition United will be playing against regularly, and, even so, they looked decent for being hopelessly outgunned. Marcus Rashford is still going to be king someday. Henrikh Mkhitaryan looked threatening. Romelu Lukaku’s first touch wasn’t nearly &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4689238/Man-Utd-fans-react-Lukaku-s-touch-goes-wrong.html"&gt;as awful as advertised&lt;/a&gt;. The striker, formerly of Everton, coolly tucked away what would ultimately be a consolation goal in the 62nd minute, and if he’d converted the sitter he missed earlier in the evening, maybe the game would’ve gone to the wonderfully unpredictable world of extra time, where anything, usually the dumbest thing, can happen. But as long as we’re mourning missed chances, Madrid could’ve easily won something like 6-2. (And United &lt;a href="http://statsbomb.com/2017/08/manchester-united-201718-season-preview/"&gt;could be&lt;/a&gt; going into this year’s Champions League through the front door instead of through &lt;a href="http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2467193.html"&gt;the back&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkdBzt"&gt;Mourinho &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRWOzZ3OiFI"&gt;said it himself&lt;/a&gt; after a 1-0 preseason loss to Barcelona, though not in so few words: Clubs like Barcelona and Real Madrid are UP HERE, and Manchester United is, still, &lt;em&gt;down here&lt;/em&gt;, regardless of how much money United have thrown at the problem (nearly half a billion euros over the last three windows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mgmStl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XsKoAci-Pts?rel=0&amp;amp;" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H0GIEM"&gt;United’s brightest spot was Nemanja Matic—the most recent of their three summer signings, and perhaps the most important, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkaNews/status/895583252643143681"&gt;if you ask Phil Neville&lt;/a&gt;. Matic steadied what can often be a hectic midfield, doing all the responsible things that aren’t fun to write about. Having him around, doing most of the tackling and tracking and challenging and the less inventive part of the distributing, should free up the guy with the blond streaks to do the stuff he’s best at. Down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEvSi9"&gt;In the European Super Cup, like in a few of last campaign’s bigger games—most memorably &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Xw8lRyCOQ"&gt;an awful night&lt;/a&gt; in January, against Liverpool—Pogba was not great. Against Madrid, he wasn’t so much bad as he was inconsequential and occasionally dangerous, a singular &lt;em&gt;meh &lt;/em&gt;performance that could be written off as just that instead of it being some greater cause for concern, if he were anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPRoqM"&gt;But players that break world transfer records don’t really get to be “anyone else.” The line goes, with great disinterest in how many players are on a field together, &lt;em&gt;if the team paid a lot for you, you should be able to lift a car off of it on your own if need be. &lt;/em&gt;And that’s … not how things worked out. While everyone was still holding their breath from Casemiro clanging a free header off of the crossbar early in the game, Pogba gathered it up and galloped into a counter that could’ve ended in several different, likely more successful ways than a blocked shot from 25 yards out. He was all alone against Keylor Navas in the second half and nodded an equalizer directly into the Madrid keeper’s hands. Those are the Big Ones, both of which you’ve already seen, here, in this post. It seemed like Pogba’s touches ran long and his passes weren’t weighted quite right, if they were on target at all. He was, to sum it up, out of tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUMbDX"&gt;None of this tells us much about whether he’s good. He &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; good, just not in the ways you’d expect, and we know this already. When he’s on the ball, whatever the more difficult, inadvisable choice is, he usually makes that. All of these things—the flicks, the turns, trying to dribble out of his own defensive third—work as often as they don’t, which is frustrating, but then he’ll do something like hunt down Luka Modric in open field and start a new attacking move all on his own. There’s nothing he can’t do and there’s nothing he won’t do, except, of course, play simply. This is amplified by the fact that he plays for Mourinho, who generally likes his football in a spartan and unemotional way. Having had a full season and preseason together, they’ve gotten more used to each other, Pogba and Mourinho. The best evidence of that was a brief cut to the touchline after Pogs looked over Jesse Lingard for that 25-yarder. Lingard was annoyed, Mkhitaryan, also an option there, was understandably upset, and Mourinho clapped in encouragement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="K0QYH4"&gt;Pogba now has Matic (instead of Michael Carrick or [&lt;em&gt;shudders&lt;/em&gt;] Marouane Fellaini) at his back, Lukaku in front of him, and possibly (&lt;a href="http://www.espnfc.com/story/3174602/manchester-united-boss-jose-mourinho-inter-milan-put-up-good-defence-on-ivan-perisic"&gt;probably not&lt;/a&gt;) Ivan Perisic to his left before transfer-deadline day. It’ll be interesting to see what Pogba does with all of this newfound peace of mind, and what that’ll mean for a brawny United team that looks way more ominous now than it did at this time last year. In any case, the excuses are drying up. Last season’s struggles can be explained away as Pogba getting reacquainted with the rude, dispassionate pace of the Premier League, a new manager, and a team that looked nothing like the one Pogba left in 2012. There’s none of that to lean on anymore. We’ve yet to see the best out of him, and this year, with this cast, it’s poised to show. It has to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Whit Merrifield Looks Like the Next David Eckstein—but He’s Way Better</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uvGT2w68ibXkR1a2tFjxVtyzBe0=/0x0:2261x1696/400x300/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56154819/Whit_Merrifield_getty_ringer.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;The Kansas City second baseman came out of nowhere to become one of the best players at his position&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="EDlpRe"&gt;Whit Merrifield’s greatest moment in baseball was supposed to be his last of any consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="buz1A0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75.0019%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGGkJxkeHBg?rel=0&amp;amp;" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6K6pfJ"&gt;Even on a South Carolina team that had only one player drafted in the first three rounds—Jackie Bradley Jr.—Merrifield didn’t stand out. He was a 6-foot corner outfielder with the potential to be a grinder, which is what you say about a player when you can’t find anything nice to say about his tools. Merrifield seemed like a lock to kick around in the minor leagues for a few years, make it to Double-A, stall, and, at some point in his late 20s, decide he’d rather be a coach or a scout, or just go back to Columbia, South Carolina, and never pay for a beer again as long as he lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oMKeL"&gt;Merrifield lasted until the ninth round of the 2010 draft—269th overall, three picks ahead of a shortstop-conversion lottery ticket out of Stetson named Jacob deGrom—and signed with the Royals for $100,000. He didn’t break an .800 OPS in the minors until his third trip through Double-A. Merrifield played all three outfield positions and all four infield positions, splitting most of his time (a little more than 2,000 innings each) between second base and left field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOcnkH"&gt;In May 2016, Kansas City could no longer countenance playing Omar Infante (63 OPS+ in 1,179 PA with the Royals) at second base, so up came the 27-year-old Merrifield. He was no kind of prospect, but it was fun to see him make the Show in the same way that it’s fun when a character actor you liked on &lt;em&gt;ER&lt;/em&gt; gets an arc on &lt;em&gt;Madam Secretary&lt;/em&gt;—“Oh, remember how great he was as that guy who lost his arm in a bike accident? Good to see he’s still working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6WaqC"&gt;Merrifield did well, relatively speaking—a 90 OPS+ in 332 PA for a team whose OPS+ leader was Drew Butera isn’t nothing—but 27-year-old rookie utilitymen tend not to be worth getting attached to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjLCIc"&gt;So &lt;a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/play-index/tiny.fcgi?id=zHxfc"&gt;this bWAR leaderboard for second basemen&lt;/a&gt; is nothing short of mind-blowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="46qLdK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:583858"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="93UZnV"&gt;José Altuve’s leading not only second basemen but all MLB position players in WAR. Schoop made his first All-Star team and is going to hit at least 30 home runs, and then—before you get to Ian Kinsler or Robinson Canó or Daniel Murphy or Brian Dozier—you get to Merrifield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjeTdZ"&gt;Merrifield’s hitting .297/.333/.482 with 19 stolen bases in 21 attempts and average-to-above-average defense at second. He isn’t putting up Aaron Judge’s hard-contact rate, and he isn’t walking much, but he is avoiding strikeouts (13.3 K%, down more than a third from his 2016 rate and 19th best out of 156 qualified hitters), and he’s maintained his flair for the dramatic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H3f0v5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGI-5jWVwdg?rel=0&amp;amp;" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0VuRj2"&gt;Since Merrifield broadly fits the &lt;a href="http://www.firejoemorgan.com/2007/12/seeking-new-angle-reporter-turns-to.html"&gt;David Eckstein archetype&lt;/a&gt;, and because of that walk-off hit against UCLA seven years ago, it’s tempting to label him as a “winner.” Merrifield’s .297 batting average and 90 percent stolen base success rate are more valuable to the Royals than any of his metaphysical attributes, but he has come up big in important moments this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JI6jIw"&gt;Merrifield is hitting .304/.368/.446 in high-leverage situations (a 117 sOPS+). In late and close situations, which Baseball-Reference defines as “plate appearances in the seventh or later with the batting team tied, ahead by one, or the tying run at least on deck,” Merrifield is hitting .340/.393/.638, which is a 188 sOPS+, the 13th best among 181 batters with at least 50 late and close plate appearances this season. Merrifield is also third among second basemen, and 30th overall, in win probability added. During the nine-game winning streak that reinserted the Royals into the wild-card hunt, he hit .350/.386/.675 with four home runs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fWM6O"&gt;Even if this is just an anomaly, and Merrifield’s clutchness evens out over time, he’s still turned himself—suddenly and much later than is the case for most breakout hitters—into a very good big league player. Merrifield is within spitting distance of posting a four-win season, which is a mark 40 second basemen have reached since 2000. If &lt;a href="https://bbref.com/pi/shareit/tVboD"&gt;you look at the list&lt;/a&gt;, there isn’t a bad player among them—even Ronnie Belliard was a 20-win player for his career, and Darwin Barney’s wrung eight seasons and counting out of his glove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMNdQZ"&gt;The way Merrifield’s hitting (.333/.365/.556 in 126 PA since the break), he might reach five wins, a barrier &lt;a href="https://bbref.com/pi/shareit/xPmcz"&gt;only 26 second basemen have broken since 2000&lt;/a&gt;. Once players hit that level, they regress, they age, they drop off, but they don’t turn all the way back into pumpkins overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="S29cSP"&gt;Merrifield has carved out a big league career for himself no matter what, even if it’s unlikely that he continues to play like a supernatural clutch monster. Then again, he wasn’t even likely to make it out of Double-A, so you never know.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Donald Trump’s Vacation to Nowhere</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BqNEifCvsC_tbOS5d5avz7hy1a4=/87x0:2754x2000/400x300/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56151761/isolated_trump_getty_ringer.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;A chaotic president is having another chaotic week, but you wouldn't know it in Bedminster&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="G9DHM0"&gt;On the afternoon that Donald Trump threatened North Korea with “fire and fury” and the world busied itself with imagining what exactly a 21st-century nuclear war would entail, a man in Bridgewater, New Jersey, sidled up to the bar at Maggiano’s and ordered a glass of red wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrymEm"&gt;The restaurant is hard to miss. It shines like a jewel alongside Bridgewater’s marquee attraction: a triple-decker mall that will set you up with everything from Uniqlo to Hot Topic to really good—seriously—empanadas in the food court. A quarter or so past 5 p.m. on each and every weekday, the bar at Maggiano’s starts to fill up, thanks largely to out-of-town pharmaceutical employees who stream from two towers down the road to the Marriott on the corner and, from there, directly on to the Maggiano’s bar. In the winter they shuffle across the street in parka-clad packs, like penguins. But Leroy was there early, to beat the rush and maybe make a dent in the gift certificate his son gave him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdeJ7z"&gt;He was a union man, he said, by way of explaining that his interest in Trump began and ended with concern over the &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/trump_bedminster_airports.html"&gt;30-mile flight restriction&lt;/a&gt; imposed for the duration of the president’s stay at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, maybe a 15-minute drive away. A few minutes after a motorcade passed by carrying Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway to a press briefing at the Marriott—no sirens or anything, just a couple of discreet blue and red lights on the dashboards of a line of dark SUVs—Leroy ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. “Kellyanne?” he asked, his eyes growing wide. “She’s over &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0RzweU"&gt;The next day, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, suffering from a bad cold, would stand in the Marriott lobby and tell reporters that no, Trump’s aggressive statement on North Korea was very much part of the administration’s strategic plan. Then she would quietly get into a van and leave for Bedminster, passing the Maggiano’s on her way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="yyTqpz"&gt;Someday, there will be Donald Trump history tours. Tour buses will pull up alongside Notable Trump Sites, and out will spill vacationing empty-nesters and tweens on eighth-grade field trips and Ph.D.s in search of undigitized artifacts. There will be pilgrimages by devotees born long after the 45th president’s time in office wraps up, and they’ll leap out of beat-up Ford Fusions or Chevy Hovercraft 300s in vintage Make America Great Again caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gz34Y"&gt;To guide these future, Trump-as-quirky-pitstop people, there will be commemorative maps, maybe with gold stars to steer them from landmark A to B to C. There will be one for Trump’s childhood home in Queens, which has even now been rebranded the Trump Birth House by unknown buyers and &lt;a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/donald-trump-s-childhood-home-listed-on-airbnb-1.13955544"&gt;listed on Airbnb for $600 a night&lt;/a&gt;. There will be another star for his sumptuous high-rise in Midtown Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFOVDs"&gt;And then, 45 miles to the west of New York City, there will be what in all likelihood will be the most visited, most school-bused, most walking-toured, and most, yes, holy, because it’s the one which figures to be his final resting place: Bedminster. If Trump is buried there—a significant possibility, given he’s repeatedly petitioned the county and state for permission to build a mausoleum on the grounds of his golf course and spoken at length of his desire to spend eternity in the rolling central Jersey hills—Bedminster and its neighboring hamlets will be Trumpland in perpetuity. Should that happen, for decades hence, maître d's who haven’t even been born yet will grow weary of directing lost tourists up the road—get back onto 287, hang a couple of lefts, and stop before you hit 78. Future members of the Bridgewater police department will post &lt;em&gt;NO BUS IDLING&lt;/em&gt; signs; gift shops on nearby Somerville’s tony Main Street will sell Trump bobbleheads and toupeed plushies and goodies we haven’t quite imagined yet: Trump vs. McConnell boxing robots, miniature border walls, mushroom cloud Christmas ornaments. Bedminster and its environs, more so than any other place except West Palm Beach’s Mar-a-Lago, are likely to be twinned with Trump forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOS5xu"&gt;Which makes it a little bit weird that hardly anyone even knows he’s in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITowPA"&gt;Trump is on vacation, the first extended one of his now seven-month-old presidency. Even now, a week into the announced 17-day sojourn, the administration insists that it is not a getaway at all: “This is not a vacation—meetings and calls!” Trump tweeted after arriving. But he has repeatedly been pictured out golfing and members of the traveling press pool have almost daily been told there will be no news, being dispatched instead to wander through the mall and sample empanadas. The president has stationed himself at a luxurious, 535-acre estate built for the exclusive purposes of strolling, swinging, sunning, and dining. That this comes from a man who spent much of Barack Obama’s presidency complaining about no. 44’s vacations—“Can you believe that, with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf,” came one representative tweet in 2014—has inspired the predictable outcry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMiRGz"&gt;However you measure these things, the Trump presidency has been loud. The pandemonium caused by Trump’s Tuesday threat toward North Korea was, in its own way, business as usual. Brash, bombastic comment from Trump that may or may not, despite Sanders’s later insistence, have been run by his advisers beforehand? Check. Days-long media frenzy in the aftermath? Check. Steady &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/09/politics/north-korea-donald-trump/index.html"&gt;walking back&lt;/a&gt; by deputies after the fact? Check. You can argue, with varying degrees of risibility, that the chaos is intentional: Fox News host Jesse Watters said as much on Wednesday, when he argued on &lt;em&gt;The Five&lt;/em&gt; that Trump “being unpredictable is a big asset, [because] North Korea knew exactly what President Obama was going to do.” (The president subsequently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheFive/status/895451762122833921"&gt;retweeted&lt;/a&gt; the quote.) But it is chaos nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EHffLN"&gt;And yet, in Bedminster—which Trump won in November with a margin of eight votes—there is simply quiet. Few in the area seem to have any idea the president is there at all, and, when informed that he is, mostly respond with mild interest, like you told them your grandmother had just arrived for a visit. Trump is not, after all, exactly in town: When he’s in Bedminster, he is very specifically at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster. (The town of Bedminster itself is so small that staff and reporters are obliged to stay in the next town over instead; visiting television producers have repeatedly expressed anguish that, absent an accessible Bedminster sign, they’re forced to broadcast in front of a busy road in Bridgewater, an altogether less exotic dateline.) On Friday, August 4, the presidential helicopter, Marine One, lifted off from Morristown Municipal Airport, setting down at Trump National just before 6 p.m. Trump hasn’t emerged from the club since. He is not expected to until Sunday, when he returns to Manhattan for three nights at Trump Tower. After that, he will likely return to Bedminster for a final few days at the golf course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BRIq0"&gt;His time in Bedminster is hardly out of character. While presidents usually like to use their dining as a form of folksy diplomacy—a dinky diner here, a regional delicacy there, a not-quite-candid picture with beaming restaurant staff over there—Trump has been a remarkable homebody. Apart from his three trips abroad, he has not once since taking office publicly dined in a property that he did not live in or own. In Washington, D.C., he has gone out for dinner only a handful of times, each and every one of them at his downtown hotel. He has taken day trips to his golf club in Virginia on 15 occasions, and spent seven weekends at the crown jewel of his club system, Mar-a-Lago, where he was similarly cloistered. After Mar-a-Lago closed for the summer months, Trump began vacationing to the north. His August vacation marks his fifth presidential visit to Bedminster—his sixth, if you count the weekend in July when a rally took him back to D.C. and then he opted to return to New Jersey that evening anyway. On each occasion, he has either helicoptered or motorcaded into the grounds and then remained there, safe from the view of everyone but his guests and club members, who for this honor pay $22,100 a year plus &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/six-questions-about-trump-bedminster-this-weekends-weekend-white-house/2017/05/05/a1d9ddc8-319b-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html"&gt;somewhere north of $75,000&lt;/a&gt; as an initiation fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZB4njL"&gt;It makes for a starkly different scene than his predecessor. While president, Obama typically took two long vacations each year: one over Christmas to his native Hawaii, and one in August to Martha's Vineyard. In both locales, he and his family rented homes in exclusive neighborhoods alongside a cast of friends and senior White House staff. And in both locales, the Obamas were gadabouts during their stay, dining out at the same restaurants year after year. It became something of a parlor game for locals and fellow vacationers: Was this the night that the Obamas would show up at Alan Wong's? They haven't turned up at L’Étoile yet—would it be wise to make a reservation there in the hope of catching a glimpse? Obama tended to make a show of rotating through different golf courses—worth setting a tee time just in case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxEyux"&gt;In Martha's Vineyard, Obama’s motorcade snaked through the island's roads, a police escort leading the two dark vans containing the president and his fellow passengers. Sasha got a job at local seafood institution Nancy's. Still, it was hardly egalitarian: Even on ritzy Martha’s Vineyard, Obama tended toward the most exclusive destinations, and was always ensconced behind police barricades, slipping out of vans and directly into the back exits of restaurants, from which he and his family were escorted to private rooms. But he made a show of acknowledging the throngs of giddy onlookers, who gathered invariably at those barricades whenever and wherever they were erected. After finishing a meal, the odds were good that Obama would duck past his waiting ride to wave to the crowd, and perhaps walk down the street to the corner ice cream parlor. It was a way of scattering The Time I Saw Obama stories into the crowd, a shared sort of presidency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTv83t"&gt;But now we have New Jersey. We have the Buffalo Wild Wings on the side of 22, the Friendly’s, the strip mall with the shop specializing in XXXL clothing for men. We have those rolling green hills, the 4-H signs on highway overpasses. We have jug handles. We have the wraparound bar at McCormick’s where everyone is playing pool, and the BYOB arcade just off the very Main Street where Trumpian knickknacks might be sold 100 years from now, where on the right night you might find reporters and maybe some Trump aides playing &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, where the locals neither notice nor care. Where there’s a really great classic car show put on every summer Friday in Somerset with live music, the kind of silly local thing a different president in different times might pop by to shake some hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1PcG3"&gt;But the club is out of the way. It’s not on the way to anything; to get a glimpse of it, you have to go there directly, and if you go there directly, you’ll pull up to the lovely little stone booth by a sign proclaiming it the site of last month’s U.S. Women’s Open, and a nice young man in a lilac polo shirt will ask smilingly just what you think you, a non-member, are doing there. This is assuming you have been permitted to pass a pair of waiting Secret Service agents, who as a rule are not nice. Ask around, and you will learn that everyone seems to have heard it’s pretty nice at Trump National. (You will also learn that the all-you-can-eat lunch special at Sushi Palace is just $10 and really—&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;, no, seriously, don’t laugh, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;—good. It is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AN4u2Q"&gt;The result of Trump’s approach to the presidency, both while vacationing and while more plausibly at work, is a profound sense of isolation. The darker imaginings have him alone for hours at a time, clad in a bathrobe—a detail heartily denied by the White House—and lying in bed as he watches cable news, phone in hand, tweeting as the inspiration arrives. As president, the world he has fashioned is almost breathtakingly small and is composed entirely of the familiar. And yet from this calm and stationary island, he not only manages to wreak havoc far and wide, but also seems to enjoy doing so. He is a sort of roving eye of the storm—one that is nearly always of his own making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8X6zJ"&gt;There are some rationales for the self-cosseting, of course. Trump entered office with razor-thin margins in many states, and lost the popular vote. His first moments in office were spent standing on the steps of the U.S. Capitol building and gazing out upon a visibly sparse inaugural crowd; his first full day was one in which much of the country erupted in protests against him. He has made decisions since then, notably not to tack to any sort of center, and he has been rewarded with &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/"&gt;dismal approval ratings&lt;/a&gt;. If he were to wander out for an ice cream cone, it’s very possible that he wouldn’t be met with cheering crowds. And indeed, he has pulled the plug on outings where such a thing might occur, telling British Prime Minister Theresa May that he would not visit the U.K. until she could guarantee him &lt;a href="http://nypost.com/2017/07/16/trump-wants-theresa-may-to-fix-a-warm-welcome-for-him/"&gt;a welcoming audience&lt;/a&gt;. He has insisted that he’s stayed away from Manhattan’s Trump Tower to spare New Yorkers the traffic jam; come this weekend, we’ll see if the city’s response to his homecoming suggests a different reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="dgwG8B"&gt;Toward the end of his presidency, Obama spoke often of missing his anonymity, of the ability, surely, to wander into someplace like Maggiano’s, grab a stool beside the Leroys and the pharma execs, pick up a complimentary copy of the &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; sports pages, and not be bothered. With Trump, it’s becoming clear he never wanted to be there at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dc5rVm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The New England Patriots Have Mastered the Art of the Steal</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pyNP35kjPgY1Jg8Q-E2lMs68RP0=/87x0:2754x2000/400x300/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56149517/PW_UnderTheRadarTalent_NOBUG_Getty_Ringer.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;How does Bill Belichick keep bringing in under-the-radar talent on the cheap?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="JkadaI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all — well, most of us — agree with you: The Patriots are an insufferable football machine that must be stopped. But here’s the thing: Can anyone stop them? Five weeks before &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/nfl-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the season kicks off&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, New England is favored to win every game it plays in 2017. Sixteen years since their first Super Bowl win and 10 since their 16–0 regular season, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick are still the class of the NFL. So, welcome to — ugh, yes — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/8/8/16116342/2017-nfl-preview-patriots-week"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patriots Week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;! Ahead of what could be the most dominant New England season yet, read along as we take a look at the good, the bad, and the Jets-y of modern football’s defining dynasty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fcI4sW"&gt;
&lt;p id="bA0MIa"&gt;If it seems like the Patriots are randomly plucking players from nowhere and vaulting them toward stardom, they’re not. They’re doing it all by design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="2017 NFL Preview" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qgk0cvnjYNEC8bbBIuZrtBE6M5Q=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9033647/2017_NFL_preview.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i3Wvgo"&gt;“When the season started, [Bill Belichick] showed us an empty depth chart,” said Rodney Harrison, former Patriots safety and current analyst with NBC Sports. “He does not care how many Pro Bowls you’ve made. He says: I don’t make the depth chart; you guys make the depth chart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xcj4R2"&gt;In 2003, Harrison was widely seen as banged up and on the wrong side of 30. He’d been released by the Chargers, and he joined a Patriots team with longtime stalwart safety Lawyer Milloy already on the roster. Belichick &lt;a href="https://www.si.com/vault/2003/09/01/348889/2-new-england-patriots-while-the-offense-stands-pat-a-rebuilt-defense-looks-to-regain-that-super-bowl-swagger"&gt;told Harrison&lt;/a&gt; that he brought him in because he &lt;em&gt;liked the way he warmed up for games. &lt;/em&gt;He felt Harrison was worth a look. This is how Belichick operates: He needs to see everything for himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYmZto"&gt;“In my first month in camp, he saw what I could do and named me a team captain,” Harrison said. “He said, ‘You’re a great athlete. You can guard the tight end.’ He figured out that I could line up as a straight linebacker or blitz off the edge or the middle.” Harrison also said that Belichick praised him for his smarts: “He’ll take a slightly less talented player if he’s got a higher football IQ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9ITwa"&gt;There are plenty of factors that make the Patriots the most dominant team of their era—Tom Brady and Bill Belichick top among them. But here’s another big reason: the organization’s ability to generate contributors on cheap contracts and to acquire them at low costs through trade, restricted free agency, or waivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HLsYs"&gt;Harrison headlines the group of undervalued additions, along with Wes Welker, Mike Vrabel, Dion Lewis, Rob Ninkovich, and many more. Last season, receiver Chris Hogan joined the list. Offseason arrivals Kony Ealy, Mike Gillislee, and Rex Burkhead could do the same this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1idTVV"&gt;“They are good at finding guys here,” Hogan said, in one of the understatements of the century. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3k3yA"&gt;There have been plenty of busts in the Patriots’ quest for value—let’s never speak of Chad Ochocinco, Reggie Wayne, or Albert Haynesworth again—but the wins outweigh the losses because the investments never cost all that much. If someone doesn’t work out, they move on to the next guy. Meanwhile, the five Super Bowl wins in 15 years speak to the benefits of the approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPiYHb"&gt;Here’s how they do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FDuQIj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They Are Geniuses in the Spring &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="AfxEIp"&gt;“They take advantage of the Buffalo Bills’ inability to tender anyone properly,” said former agent and salary cap expert Joel Corry, taking a jab at Buffalo’s failure to keep either Hogan last year or Gillislee this year. “No one uses restricted free agency better than the Patriots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzSVys"&gt;During their run of dominance, restricted free agency has been as much a signature tool of the Patriots as the two-tight-end set. Welker was a restricted free agent when the Patriots traded for him in 2007. And they &lt;a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000416649/article/emmanuel-sanders-nearly-signed-with-patriots"&gt;nearly stole&lt;/a&gt; Emmanuel Sanders in restricted free agency in 2013, too, but the Steelers eventually matched New England’s offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBY8Q4"&gt;Restricted free agency terrifies most teams simply because, Corry said, it’s rarely used and it’s complicated. The Patriots love it: For one, they know they are getting young, proven, cost-controlled players and they know exactly what they have to give up. When a player reaches restricted free agency, teams can place a tender on him to ensure that if they lose the player, they’d receive a first-round or second-round pick, or a pick in the round in which the player was originally drafted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqG68A"&gt;In Gillislee’s case, the Bills placed a fifth-round tender on him, since he was selected in the fifth round of the 2013 draft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6w226"&gt;“If I had to use one word to describe it, it would be: genius,” said Ron Butler, Gillislee’s agent, when asked about the Patriots’ approach. Butler said that he didn’t anticipate any team approaching his client after the Bills put a fifth-round tender on him, since those tenders normally scare teams away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnlOBB"&gt;The 26-year-old was buried in Buffalo behind superstar LeSean McCoy; why give up a pick for a guy who can’t find consistent playing time? Well, you don’t have to dig deep to see how productive he can be: Numberfire, an advanced analytics site, said that Gillislee’s 2016 performance was the most efficient rushing season &lt;a href="https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/news/12615/mike-gillislee-had-the-most-efficient-rushing-season-of-the-century"&gt;this century&lt;/a&gt;. During camp, Gillislee said that he pays “a little bit” of attention to his adoration in advanced statistical circles, but that he mostly doesn’t care about any numbers. The Patriots, on the other hand, care deeply.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8psALG"&gt;Corry said the Patriots love trading for players because only their salary counts against the cap. New England lets the team that drafted and/or signed the player to the initial contract take the cap hit for the signing bonus, then they acquire the lowest-risk portion of the deal,  since the dead cap money usually stays with the team that initially signed the player. Tight end Dwayne Allen came over from Indianapolis in the spring. He will count $3 million against the Colts' cap this year and $4.5 million against the Patriots’. Any production he provides New England will come at a near-50 percent discount.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ApIfuL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They Tinker &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2e4YSR"&gt;Earlier this week, my colleague Danny Kelly &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2017/8/7/16099322/2017-nfl-preview-bill-belichick-football-breakdowns"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; how, although Belichick is known for terse press conferences, he’ll occasionally offer up detailed football-nerd lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQX5Aj"&gt;My favorite look into his football soul came during a 2014 press conference in which he detailed why the Patriots were able to get two steals—Vrabel and Rosevelt Colvin—who became key cogs for the mid-2000s teams. The reason they were able to grab Vrabel and Colvin on the cheap: Along with only two other teams, the Patriots were playing the 3-4 defense, so most players who fit their defense didn’t necessarily fit those of 29 other clubs. When you value someone that almost no one else does, it’s easy to find a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4MWsv"&gt;“It was us, Pittsburgh, and I don't know where the other team was,” Belichick &lt;a href="http://www.patriots.com/news/2014/12/31/patriots-quotes-1231-bill-belichick-tom-brady-and-more"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “So, if you wanted a nose tackle, there were plenty of them out there. If you wanted a 3-4 outside linebacker, there were plenty of them out there. Guys like—Colvin was a good example at Chicago or even Vrabel, those 3-4 outside linebackers, but there's nowhere to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6k6sr"&gt;He doesn’t stop there. Belichick then suggests that part of the reason New England eventually moved away from a typical 3-4 is that too many teams adopted it, and thus those types of players became overvalued. This has always been the Belichick mantra: find players who adequately perform underrated tasks. That’s one of the reasons &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2017/8/7/16107814/2007-new-england-patriots-tom-brady-randy-moss-wes-welker"&gt;he started putting resources toward the slot receiver&lt;/a&gt; before anyone else: Outside receivers were usually too expensive in the late 2000s. That’s also why he went to two tight ends in the next decade: The slot receiver became too overvalued. Belichick finds hidden gems because no one else is looking for what he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WQ3LBq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They Have a Plan &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pGSaQy"&gt;More than any other team, according to Patriots sources, Belichick puts the onus on his coaches to come up with plans for specific players. Other coaches just expect all of their players to fit their system. Essentially, Belichick’s approach is an extension of the “Do Your Job” mantra: They are going to bring in players with certain skill sets, and it’s a coach’s job to figure out exactly how they’ll be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myNogz"&gt;The Patriots are the NFL’s best argument for being open-minded: Week to week, the game plan changes, and different players take on bigger roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mw4APw"&gt;Look at Hogan, who, after totaling a solid 680 yards during the season, had a breakout playoff performance in the AFC championship game against Pittsburgh for 180 yards receiving and two touchdowns. Hogan’s role in that game was to take the top off of the defense whenever he could. The Steelers blew their coverage enough that Hogan became a playoff star. Don’t be surprised when one of New England’s 2017 steals does the same.&lt;/p&gt;
